        Promise.resolve(value) creates a resolved promise with the result value.
        Same as:
        let promise = new Promise(resolve => resolve(value));

        The method is used for compatibility, when a function is expected to return a promise.

        For example, the loadCached function below fetches a URL and remembers (caches) its content. For future 
        calls with the same URL it immediately gets the previous content from cache, but uses Promise.resolve 
        to make a promise of it, so the returned value is always a promise:

        */

        let cache = new Map();

        function loadCached(url) {
        if (cache.has(url)) {
            return Promise.resolve(cache.get(url)); // (*)
        }

        return fetch(url)
            .then(response => response.text())
            .then(text => {
            cache.set(url,text);
            return text;
            });
        }

        /*
            We can write loadCached(url).then(…), because the function is guaranteed to return a promise. We 
            can always use .then after loadCached. That’s the purpose of Promise.resolve in the line (*).
