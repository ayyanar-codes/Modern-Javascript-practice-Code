            Similar to Promise.race, but waits only for the first fulfilled promise and gets its result. 
            If all of the given promises are rejected, then the returned promise is rejected with 
            AggregateError – a special error object that stores all promise errors in its errors property.

            The syntax is:
            let promise = Promise.any(iterable);

            For instance, here the result will be 1:
        */

            new Promise((resolve, reject) => setTimeout(() => resolve(3), 3000))
        ]).then(alert); // 1

        /*
            The first promise here was fastest, but it was rejected, so the second promise became the result. 
            After the first fulfilled promise “wins the race”, all further results are ignored.
