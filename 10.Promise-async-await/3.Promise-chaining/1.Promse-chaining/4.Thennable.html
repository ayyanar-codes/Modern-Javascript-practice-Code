        To be precise, a handler may return not exactly a promise, but a so-called 
        “thenable” object – an arbitrary object that has a method .then. It will be 
        treated the same way as a promise.

        The idea is that 3rd-party libraries may implement “promise-compatible” objects of 
        their own. They can have an extended set of methods, but also be compatible with 
        native promises, because they implement .then.

        Here’s an example of a thenable object:
        */
        class Thenable {
            constructor(num) {
                this.num = num;
            }
            then(resolve, reject) {
                alert(resolve); // function() { native code }
                // resolve with this.num*2 after the 1 second
                setTimeout(() => resolve(this.num * 2), 1000); // (**)
            }
        }

        new Promise(resolve => resolve(1))
            .then(result => {
            return new Thenable(result); // (*)
        })
        .then(alert); // shows 2 after 1000ms

        /*

        JavaScript checks the object returned by the .then handler in line (*): if it has a
         callable method named then, then it calls that method providing native functions 
         resolve, reject as arguments (similar to an executor) and waits until one of them 
         is called. In the example above resolve(2) is called after 1 second (**). Then the 
         result is passed further down the chain.

        This feature allows us to integrate custom objects with promise chains without 
        having to inherit from Promise.
