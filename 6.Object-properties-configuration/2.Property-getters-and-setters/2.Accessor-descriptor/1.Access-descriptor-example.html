            Descriptors for accessor properties are different from those for data properties.
            For accessor properties, there is no value or writable, but instead there are get and set functions.

            That is, an accessor descriptor may have:
                get – a function without arguments, that works when a property is read,
                set – a function with one argument, that is called when the property is set,
                enumerable – same as for data properties,
                configurable – same as for data properties.

            For instance, to create an accessor fullName with defineProperty, we can pass a descriptor with get and set:
        */

        let user={
            name:'Ayyanar',
            surName:'Ayyanar2',
        }


        Object.defineProperty(user, 'fullName',{
            get(){
                return this.name+' '+this.surName;
            },
            set(value){
                [this.name, this.surName]=value.split(' ');
            }
        });

        alert(user.fullName);

        user.fullName="Saravana Kumar";

        alert(user.fullName);
