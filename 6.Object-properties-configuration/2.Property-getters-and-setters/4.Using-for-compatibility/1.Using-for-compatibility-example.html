        /*
            One of the great uses of accessors is that they allow to take control over a “regular” data 
            property at any moment by replacing it with a getter and a setter and tweak its behavior.

            Imagine we started implementing user objects using data properties name and age:

            function User(name, age) {
                this.name = name;
                this.age = age;
            }

            let john = new User("John", 25);

            alert( john.age ); // 25


            But sooner or later, things may change. Instead of age we may decide to store birthday, 
            because it’s more precise and convenient:

            function User(name, birthday) {
                this.name = name;
                this.birthday = birthday;
            }

            let john = new User("John", new Date(1992, 6, 1));

            Now what to do with the old code that still uses age property?

            We can try to find all such places and fix them, but that takes time and can be hard to do if 
            that code is used by many other people. And besides, age is a nice thing to have in user, right?

            Let’s keep it.
            Adding a getter for age solves the problem:


        */

        function User(name, birthday) {
        this.name = name;
        this.birthday = birthday;

            // age is calculated from the current date and birthday
            Object.defineProperty(this, "age", {
                get() {
                let todayYear = new Date().getFullYear();
                return todayYear - this.birthday.getFullYear();
                }
            });
        }

        let john = new User("John", new Date(1992, 6, 1));

        alert( john.birthday ); // birthday is available
        alert( john.age );      // ...as well as the age

        //Now the old code works too and we’ve got a nice additional property.
