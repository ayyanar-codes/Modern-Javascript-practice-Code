    When you use a developer console to run code, please note that
    it does not use strict mode by default some times, when use strict
    makes a difference you will get incorrect results.

    So, how actually use strict mode in console?

    first, you can try press shift+Enter to input multiple lines, and put 'use strict'
    on the top.
