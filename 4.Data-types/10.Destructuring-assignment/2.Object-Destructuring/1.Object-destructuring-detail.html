        /*
            The two most used data structures in JavaScript are Object and Array.

            Objects allow us to create a single entity that stores data items by key.
            Arrays allow us to gather data items into an ordered list.
            Although, when we pass those to a function, it may need not be an object/array as a whole. It may need individual pieces.

            Destructuring assignment is a special syntax that allows us to “unpack” arrays or objects into a bunch of variables, as sometimes that’s more convenient.

            Destructuring also works great with complex functions that have a lot of parameters, default values, and so on. Soon we’ll see that.
