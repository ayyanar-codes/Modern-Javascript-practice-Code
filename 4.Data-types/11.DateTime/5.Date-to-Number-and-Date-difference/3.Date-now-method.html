            If we only want to measure time, we dont need the date object.

            There is a special method Date.now() that return the current timestamp.

            It is semantically equivalent to new Date().getTime(). But it does not create
            intermediate Date object. So it's faster and pressure on garbage collection.

            It is is used mostly for convenience or when performance matters, like in games in 
            javascript or other specialized applications

            so, this is probably better:
        */


        let start=Date.now();
        //milliseconds count from 1 jan 1970

        //do the job
        for(let i=0; i<100000; i++){
            let someThing=i*i*i;
        }

        let end=Date.now(); //Done

        alert(`The loop took ${end-start}ms`);
        //subtract numbers, not dates
