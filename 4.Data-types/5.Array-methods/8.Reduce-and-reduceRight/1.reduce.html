        When we need to iterate over an array, we can use forEach, for, for..Of

        when we need to iterate and return the data for each element, we can use map

        The methods recuce and reduceRight also beong to the breed, but a little bit
        more intricate. They are used to cslculate a single value based on the array.

        Syntax
        let value=arr.reduce(function(accumulator, item, index, array){
            //...
        }, [initial]);

        accumulator:
        is the result of previous function call., Equals Initial the first time (If initial is 
        provided)

        item:
        is the current array item

        index:
        is its position

        array:
        is the array

        As function is applied, the result of previous call is passed to the next one as the 
        first argument

        

        */


        let arr=[1,2,3,4,5];
        let result=arr.reduce((sum, current)=>sum+current, 0);
        alert(result);

        //reduce method without initial value is not recommented
