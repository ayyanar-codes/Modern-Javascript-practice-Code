There are tree methods in javascript to get a substring. 

1.Slice
2.SubStr
3.substring


Which one to choose?
Allof them can do the same job. Formally, substr has a little draback:it is described  
not in the core javascript specification, BUt in Annex B, Which covers browser only features.
That exist mainly of rhistorical reasons. So, non-browser environments amy fail to support it.
But in practice it works averywhere.

Of the other two variants, slice is the little bit more flexible. it allows negative arguments
and shorter to write. So its enough to remember soley slice of those three methods.
