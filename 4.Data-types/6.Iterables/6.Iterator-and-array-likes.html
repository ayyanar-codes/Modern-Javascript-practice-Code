            Two official terms look similar, But are very defferent. 
            Please make sure your understand them to avoid the confusion

            a.Iterables are objects that implements the symbol.iterator method, as described above

            b.Array-likes are objects that have indexes and lengths, so they like arrays.

            Whenwe use javascript for practical tasks in a browser or any other environment,
            we may meet objects that are iterables or array likes or both.

            For Instance, strings are both Iterables (for..of) and array-like (they have numeric
            indexes and length).

            But an iterable may not be array-like. and vice-vera. an array-like may be not iterable.

            for example, the range in the example above is iterable, But not array-like. because it 
            does not have indexed properties and length.

            And here's the object that is array-like, but not iterable:

        */

        
        let arrayLike={   //has indexes and length
            0:'Hello',
            2:'world',
            length:2
        }

        //Error: (no symbol.iterator)
        for(let item of arrayLike){};

        /*
            Both iterables and array-likes are usaually not arrays , they don't have push, pop etc.
            That's rather inconvenient if we have such an object and want to work with it as with
            an array. E.g. we would like to work with range using array methods.
