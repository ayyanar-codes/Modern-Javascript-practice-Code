            The method JSON.stringify(student) takes the object and converts it into a string.
            The resulting json string is called a JSON-encoded or serialized or stringified or marshalled object. We are ready to send it over the wire or put into a plain data store.
            Please note that a JSON-encoded object has several important differences from the object literal:

                a.Strings use double quotes. No single quotes or backticks in JSON. So 'John' becomes "John".
                b.Object property names are double-quoted also. Thatâ€™s obligatory. So age:30 becomes "age":30.
