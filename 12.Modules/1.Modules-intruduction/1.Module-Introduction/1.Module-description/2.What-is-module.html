            What is a module?
            A module is just a file. One script is one module. As simple as that. Modules can load each other and 
            use special directives export and import to interchange functionality, call functions of one module 
            from another one
                1. export keyword labels variables and functions that should be accessible from outside the current module.
                2. import allows the import of functionality from other modules.
