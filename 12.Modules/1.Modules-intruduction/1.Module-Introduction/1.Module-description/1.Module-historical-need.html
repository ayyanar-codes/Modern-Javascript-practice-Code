            Modules, introduction
            As our application grows bigger, we want to split it into multiple files, so called “modules”. A module may 
            contain a class or a library of functions for a specific purpose.

            For a long time, JavaScript existed without a language-level module syntax. That wasn’t a problem, 
            because initially scripts were small and simple, so there was no need.

            But eventually scripts became more and more complex, so the community invented a variety of ways to 
            organize code into modules, special libraries to load modules on demand.

            To name some (for historical reasons):
                1.AMD – one of the most ancient module systems, initially implemented by the library require.js.
                2.CommonJS – the module system created for Node.js server.
                3.UMD – one more module system, suggested as a universal one, compatible with AMD and CommonJS.

            Now these all slowly became a part of history, but we still can find them in old scripts.

            The language-level module system appeared in the standard in 2015, gradually evolved since then, and is 
            now supported by all major browsers and in Node.js. So we’ll study the modern JavaScript modules from now
            on.
