        Module scripts are always deferred, same effect as defer attribute (described in the chapter Scripts: 
        async, defer), for both external and inline scripts.

        In other words:
            1.downloading external module scripts <script type="module" src="..."> doesn’t block HTML processing, 
            they load in parallel with other resources.
            2.module scripts wait until the HTML document is fully ready (even if they are tiny and load faster 
            than HTML), and then run.
            3.relative order of scripts is maintained: scripts that go first in the document, execute first.

        As a side effect, module scripts always “see” the fully loaded HTML-page, including HTML elements below them.

    -->

    <script type="module">
        alert(typeof button);  //Object:the script can "see" the button below
        // as modules are deferred, the script runs after the whole page is loaded
    </script>

    <!--Compare to regular script below:-->


    <script>
        alert(typeof button);  //button is undefined, the script can't see elements below
        // regular scripts run immediately, before the rest of the page is processed
    </script>

    <button id="button">Button</button>


    <!--
        Please note: the second script actually runs before the first! So we’ll see undefined 
        first, and then object.

        That’s because modules are deferred, so we wait for the document to be processed. 
        The regular script runs immediately, so we see its output first.

        When using modules, we should be aware that the HTML page shows up as it loads, 
        and JavaScript modules run after that, so the user may see the page before the 
        JavaScript application is ready. Some functionality may not work yet. We should 
        put “loading indicators”, or otherwise ensure that the visitor won’t be confused 
        by that.
