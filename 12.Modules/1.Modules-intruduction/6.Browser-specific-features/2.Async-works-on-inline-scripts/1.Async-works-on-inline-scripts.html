        For non-module scripts, the async attribute only works on external scripts. Async scripts 
        run immediately when ready, independently of other scripts or the HTML document.

        For module scripts, it works on inline scripts as well.

        For example, the inline script below has async, so it doesn’t wait for anything.

        It performs the import (fetches ./analytics.js) and runs when ready, even if the HTML document 
        is not finished yet, or if other scripts are still pending.

        That’s good for functionality that doesn’t depend on anything, like counters, ads, document-level 
        event listeners.

    <!-- all dependencies are fetched (analytics.js), and the script runs -->
    <!-- doesn't wait for the document or other <script> tags -->
    <script async type="module">
        import {counter} from './analytics.js';
        counter.count();
