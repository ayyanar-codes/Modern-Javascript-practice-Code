        In real-life, browser modules are rarely used in their “raw” form. Usually, we bundle them 
        together with a special tool such as Webpack and deploy to the production server.

        One of the benefits of using bundlers – they give more control over how modules are resolved, 
        allowing bare modules and much more, like CSS/HTML modules.

        Build tools do the following:
            1.Take a “main” module, the one intended to be put in <script type="module"> in HTML.
            2.Analyze its dependencies: imports and then imports of imports etc.
            3.Build a single file with all modules (or multiple files, that’s tunable), replacing 
            native import calls with bundler functions, so that it works. “Special” module types like 
            HTML/CSS modules are also supported.
            4.In the process, other transformations and optimizations may be applied:
                1.Unreachable code removed.
                2.Unused exports removed (“tree-shaking”).
                3.Development-specific statements like console and debugger removed.
                4.Modern, bleeding-edge JavaScript syntax may be transformed to older one with similar 
                functionality using Babel.
                5.The resulting file is minified (spaces removed, variables replaced with shorter names, etc).

        If we use bundle tools, then as scripts are bundled together into a single file (or few files), 
        import/export statements inside those scripts are replaced by special bundler functions. So the resulting 
        “bundled” script does not contain any import/export, it doesn’t require type="module", and we can put it 
        into a regular script:
    -->

    <!-- Assuming we got bundle.js from a tool like Webpack -->
    <script src="bundle.js"></script>

    <script>

    </script>
