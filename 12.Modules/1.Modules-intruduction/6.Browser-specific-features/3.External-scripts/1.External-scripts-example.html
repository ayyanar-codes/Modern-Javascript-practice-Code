    <!--
        External scripts that have type="module" are different in two aspects:
    -->

    <!--External scripts with the same src run only once:-->
    <!-- the script my.js is fetched and executed only once -->
    <script type="module" src="my.js"></script>
    <script type="module" src="my.js"></script>

    <!--
        External scripts that are fetched from another origin (e.g. another site) require 
        CORS headers, as described in the chapter Fetch: Cross-Origin Requests. In other words, 
        if a module script is fetched from another origin, the remote server must supply a header
        Access-Control-Allow-Origin allowing the fetch.
    -->

    <!-- another-site.com must supply Access-Control-Allow-Origin -->
    <!-- otherwise, the script won't execute -->
    <script type="module" src="http://another-site.com/their.js"></script>

    <!--That ensures better security by default.-->
