        In the browser, import must get either a relative or absolute URL. Modules without any 
        path are called “bare” modules. Such modules are not allowed in import.

        For instance, this import is invalid:
    -->

    <script>
        import {sayHi} from 'sayHi'; // Error, "bare" module
        // the module must have a path, e.g. './sayHi.js' or wherever the module is
    </script>

    <!--
        Certain environments, like Node.js or bundle tools allow bare modules, without any path, 
        as they have their own ways for finding modules and hooks to fine-tune them. But browsers 
        do not support bare modules yet.
