            If the same module is imported into multiple other modules, its code is executed only once, upon 
            the first import. Then its exports are given to all further importers.

            The one-time evaluation has important consequences, that we should be aware of.

            Let’s see a couple of examples.

            First, if executing a module code brings side-effects, like showing a message, then importing it 
            multiple times will trigger it only once – the first time:

            // 📁 alert.js
            alert("Module is evaluated!");

            // Import the same module from different files

            // 📁 1.js
            import `./alert.js`; // Module is evaluated!

            // 📁 2.js
            import `./alert.js`; // (shows nothing)

            The second import shows nothing, because the module has already been evaluated.

            There’s a rule: top-level module code should be used for initialization, creation of module-specific 
            internal data structures. If we need to make something callable multiple times – we should export it 
            as a function, like we did with sayHi above.

            Now, let’s consider a deeper example.

            Let’s say, a module exports an object:

            // 📁 admin.js
            export let admin = {
                name: "John"
            };

            If this module is imported from multiple files, the module is only evaluated the first time, admin 
            object is created, and then passed to all further importers.

            All importers get exactly the one and only admin object:

            // 📁 1.js
            import {admin} from './admin.js';
            admin.name = "Pete";

            // 📁 2.js
            import {admin} from './admin.js';
            alert(admin.name); // Pete

            // Both 1.js and 2.js reference the same admin object
            // Changes made in 1.js are visible in 2.js

            As you can see, when 1.js changes the name property in the imported admin, then 2.js can see the 
            new admin.name.

            That’s exactly because the module is executed only once. Exports are generated, and then they are 
            shared between importers, so if something changes the admin object, other importers will see that.



            Such behavior is actually very convenient, because it allows us to configure modules.

            In other words, a module can provide a generic functionality that needs a setup. E.g. authentication 
            needs credentials. Then it can export a configuration object expecting the outer code to assign to it.

            Here’s the classical pattern:
            1. A module exports some means of configuration, e.g. a configuration object.
            2. On the first import we initialize it, write to its properties. The top-level application script 
            may do that.
            3. Further imports use the module.

            For instance, the admin.js module may provide certain functionality (e.g. authentication), but 
            expect the credentials to come into the config object from outside:

            // 📁 admin.js
            export let config = { };

            export function sayHi() {
                alert(`Ready to serve, ${config.user}!`);
            }

            Here, admin.js exports the config object (initially empty, but may have default properties too).

            Then in init.js, the first script of our app, we import config from it and set config.user:

            // 📁 init.js
            import {config} from './admin.js';
            config.user = "Pete";

            …Now the module admin.js is configured.

            Further importers can call it, and it correctly shows the current user:

            // 📁 another.js
            import {sayHi} from './admin.js';

            sayHi(); // Ready to serve, Pete!
        */
