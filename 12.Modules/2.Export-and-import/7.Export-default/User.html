        In practice, there are mainly two kind of modules
            1.Modules that contain a library, pack of functions, like previous example.
            2.Modules that declare a single entity, e.g a module User.js exports only Class User

        Mostly the second approach is prefered, so that every 'thing' resides in its own module

        naturally, that requires a lot of files, as everything wants its own module, but that's 
        not a problem at all. Actually, code navigation becomes easier if files are well-named and 
        structured into folders 
        
        Modules provide a special export default (“the default export”) syntax to make the “one thing 
        per module” way look better.

        Put export default before the entity to export: (See connected scripts)

        Imports without curly braces look nicer. A common mistake when starting to use modules is to 
        forget curly braces at all. So, remember, import needs curly braces for named exports and 
        doesn’t need them for the default one.

        Named export	            Default export
        export class User {...}	    export default class User {...}
        import {User} from ...	    import User from ...

        Technically, we may have both default and named exports in a single module, but in practice people 
        usually don’t mix them. A module has either named exports or the default one.


        Not giving a name is fine, because there is only one export default per file, so import without 
        curly braces knows what to import.
