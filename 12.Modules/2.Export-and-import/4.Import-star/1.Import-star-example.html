    <!--Usually, we put a list of what to import in curly braces import {...}, like this:-->
    <!--Old:-->
    <script type="module">
        // 📁 main.js
        import {sayHi, sayBye} from './say.js';
        sayHi('John'); // Hello, John!
        sayBye('John'); // Bye, John!
    </script>

    <!--
        But if there’s a lot to import, we can import everything as an object using import * as 
        <obj>, for instance:
    -->

    <script type="module">
        // 📁 main.js
        import * as say from './say.js';
        say.sayHi('John');
        say.sayBye('John');
    </script>


    <!--
        At first sight, “import everything” seems such a cool thing, short to write, why should we 
        ever explicitly list what we need to import?

        Well, there are few reasons.
        Explicitly listing what to import gives shorter names: sayHi() instead of say.sayHi().
            1.Explicitly listing what to import gives shorter names: sayHi() instead of say.sayHi().
            2.Explicit list of imports gives better overview of the code structure: what is used and where. 
            It makes code support and refactoring easier.

    <!--Note:-->
    <!--
        Don’t be afraid to import too much
        Modern build tools, such as webpack and others, bundle modules together and optimize them to speedup 
        loading. They also removed unused imports.
        For instance, if you import * as library from a huge code library, and then use only few methods, then 
        unused ones will not be included into the optimzed bundle.
