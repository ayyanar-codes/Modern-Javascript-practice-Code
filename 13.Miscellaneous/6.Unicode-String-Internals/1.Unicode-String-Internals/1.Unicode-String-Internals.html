        Advanced knowledge:
        The section goes deeper into string internals. This knowledge will be useful for you 
        if you plan to deal with emoji, rare mathematical or hieroglyphic characters, or other 
        rare symbols.
    -->

    <!--
        As we already know, JavaScript strings are based on Unicode: each character is represented by a byte 
        sequence of 1-4 bytes.

        JavaScript allows us to insert a character into a string by specifying its hexadecimal Unicode code 
        with one of these three notations:
    -->

    <!--
        1. \xXX:
            XX must be two hexadecimal digits with a value between 00 and FF, then \xXX is the character whose 
            Unicode code is XX.

            Because the \xXX notation supports only two hexadecimal digits, it can be used only for the first 
            256 Unicode characters.

            These first 256 characters include the Latin alphabet, most basic syntax characters, and some others. 
            For example, "\x7A" is the same as "z" (Unicode U+007A).
    -->
    
    <script>
        alert( "\x7A" ); // z
        alert( "\xA9" ); // ©, the copyright symbol
    </script>

    <!--
        2. \uXXXX XXXX must be exactly 4 hex digits with the value between 0000 and FFFF, then \uXXXX is the 
            character whose Unicode code is XXXX.

            Characters with Unicode values greater than U+FFFF can also be represented with this notation, but in this case, 
            we will need to use a so called surrogate pair (we will talk about surrogate pairs later in this chapter).
    -->

    <script>
        alert( "\u00A9" ); // ©, the same as \xA9, using the 4-digit hex notation
        alert( "\u044F" ); // я, the Cyrillic alphabet letter
        alert( "\u2191" ); // ↑, the arrow up symbol
    </script>

    <!--
        3. \u{X…XXXXXX}
            X…XXXXXX must be a hexadecimal value of 1 to 6 bytes between 0 and 10FFFF (the highest code point 
            defined by Unicode). This notation allows us to easily represent all existing Unicode characters.
    -->

    <script>
        alert( "\u{20331}" ); // 佫, a rare Chinese character (long Unicode)
        alert( "\u{1F60D}" ); // 😍, a smiling face symbol (another long Unicode)
    </script>
