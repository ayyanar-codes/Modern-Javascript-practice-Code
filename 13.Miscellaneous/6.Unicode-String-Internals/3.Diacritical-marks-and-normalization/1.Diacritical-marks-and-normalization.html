        /*
            In many languages, there are symbols that are composed of the base character with a mark above/under it.

            For instance, the letter a can be the base character for these characters: àáâäãåā.

            Most common “composite” characters have their own code in the Unicode table. But not all of them, 
            because there are too many possible combinations.

            To support arbitrary compositions, the Unicode standard allows us to use several Unicode characters: 
            the base character followed by one or many “mark” characters that “decorate” it.

            For instance, if we have S followed by the special “dot above” character (code \u0307), it is shown as Ṡ.
        */

        alert( 'S\u0307' ); // Ṡ

        /*
            If we need an additional mark above the letter (or below it) – no problem, just add the necessary mark 
            character.

            For instance, if we append a character “dot below” (code \u0323), then we’ll have “S with dots above 
            and below”: Ṩ.

            For example:
        */

        alert( 'S\u0307\u0323' ); // Ṩ

        /*
            This provides great flexibility, but also an interesting problem: two characters may visually look the 
            same, but be represented with different Unicode compositions.

            For instance:
        */

        let s1 = 'S\u0307\u0323'; // Ṩ, S + dot above + dot below
        let s2 = 'S\u0323\u0307'; // Ṩ, S + dot below + dot above

        alert( `s1: ${s1}, s2: ${s2}` );

        alert( s1 == s2 ); // false though the characters look identical (?!)

        /*
            To solve this, there exists a “Unicode normalization” algorithm that brings each string to the single “normal” form.
            It is implemented by str.normalize().
        */

        alert( "S\u0307\u0323".normalize() == "S\u0323\u0307".normalize() ); // true

        /*
            It’s funny that in our situation normalize() actually brings together a sequence of 3 characters to 
            one: \u1e68 (S with two dots).
        */

        alert( "S\u0307\u0323".normalize().length ); // 1
        alert( "S\u0307\u0323".normalize() == "\u1e68" ); // true

        /*
            In reality, this is not always the case. The reason is that the symbol Ṩ is “common enough”, so Unicode 
            creators included it in the main table and gave it the code.

            If you want to learn more about normalization rules and variants – they are described in the appendix 
            of the Unicode standard: Unicode Normalization Forms, but for most practical purposes the information 
            from this section is enough.
