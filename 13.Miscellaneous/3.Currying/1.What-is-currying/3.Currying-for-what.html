            Currying? What for?
            To understand the benefits we need a worthy real-life example.
            For instance, we have the logging function log(date, importance, message) that formats and 
            outputs the information. In real projects such functions have many useful features like 
            sending logs over the network, here we’ll just use alert
        */

        function log(date, importance, message) {
            alert(`[${date.getHours()}:${date.getMinutes()}] [${importance}] ${message}`);
        }

        //Let’s curry it!
        log = _.curry(log);

        //After that log works normally:
        log(new Date(), "DEBUG", "some debug"); // log(a, b, c)

        //…But also works in the curried form:
        log(new Date())("DEBUG")("some debug"); // log(a)(b)(c)

        //Now we can easily make a convenience function for current logs:
        // logNow will be the partial of log with fixed first argument
        let logNow = log(new Date());

        // use it
        logNow("INFO", "message"); // [HH:mm] INFO message

        /*
            Now logNow is log with fixed first argument, in other words “partially applied function” or 
            “partial” for short.

            We can go further and make a convenience function for current debug logs:
        */

        let debugNow = logNow("DEBUG");
        debugNow("message"); // [HH:mm] DEBUG message

        /*
            So:
                1. We didn’t lose anything after currying: log is still callable normally.
                2. We can easily generate partial functions such as for today’s logs.
