            This article covers an advanced topic, to understand certain edge-cases better.
            It’s not important. Many experienced developers live fine without knowing it. Read on if you want to know how things work under the hood.

            A dynamically evaluated method call can lose this.

        /*
            On the last line there is a conditional operator that chooses either user.hi or user.bye. In this case 
            the result is user.hi.

            Then the method is immediately called with parentheses (). But it doesn’t work correctly!

            As you can see, the call results in an error, because the value of "this" inside the call becomes undefined.

        user.hi();

        //This doesn’t (evaluated method):
        (user.name == "John" ? user.hi : user.bye)(); // Error!

        //Why? If we want to understand why it happens, let’s get under the hood of how obj.method() call works.
