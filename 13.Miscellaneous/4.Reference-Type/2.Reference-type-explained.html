            Looking closely, we may notice two operations in obj.method() statement:
                1. First, the dot '.' retrieves the property obj.method.
                2. Then parentheses () execute it.
            
            So, how does the information about this get passed from the first part to the second one?

            If we put these operations on separate lines, then this will be lost for sure:

        */

        let user = {
            name: "John",
            hi() { alert(this.name); }
        };

        // split getting and calling the method in two lines
        let hi = user.hi;
        hi(); // Error, because this is undefined


        /*
            Here hi = user.hi puts the function into the variable, and then on the last line it is completely 
            standalone, and so there’s no this.

            To make user.hi() calls work, JavaScript uses a trick – the dot '.' returns not a function, but a 
            value of the special Reference Type.

            The Reference Type is a “specification type”. We can’t explicitly use it, but it is used internally 
            by the language.

            The value of Reference Type is a three-value combination (base, name, strict), where:
                1. base is the object.
                2. name is the property name.
                3. strict is true if use strict is in effect.
            
            The result of a property access user.hi is not a function, but a value of Reference Type. For user.hi 
            in strict mode it is:
        */

        // Reference Type value
        (user, "hi", true)

        /*
            When parentheses () are called on the Reference Type, they receive the full information about the 
            object and its method, and can set the right this (user in this case).

            Reference type is a special “intermediary” internal type, with the purpose to pass information from dot . 
            to calling parentheses ().

            Any other operation like assignment hi = user.hi discards the reference type as a whole, takes the value 
            of user.hi (a function) and passes it on. So any further operation “loses” this.

            So, as the result, the value of this is only passed the right way if the function is called directly 
            using a dot obj.method() or square brackets obj['method']() syntax (they do the same here). There are 
            various ways to solve this problem such as func.bind().
