        /*
            In modern programming eval is used very sparingly. It’s often said that “eval is evil”.

            The reason is simple: long, long time ago JavaScript was a much weaker language, many things 
            could only be done with eval. But that time passed a decade ago.

            Right now, there’s almost no reason to use eval. If someone is using it, there’s a good chance 
            they can replace it with a modern language construct or a JavaScript Module.

            Please note that its ability to access outer variables has side-effects.

            Code minifiers (tools used before JS gets to production, to compress it) rename local variables 
            into shorter ones (like a, b etc) to make the code smaller. That’s usually safe, but not if eval is used, as local variables may be accessed from eval’ed code string. So minifiers don’t do that renaming for all variables potentially visible from eval. That negatively affects code compression ratio.

            Using outer local variables inside eval is also considered a bad programming practice, as it makes 
            maintaining the code more difficult.

            There are two ways how to be totally safe from such problems.
        */

        //If eval’ed code doesn’t use outer variables, please call eval as window.eval(...):
        //This way the code is executed in the global scope:
        let x = 1;
        {
            let x = 5;
            window.eval('alert(x)'); // 1 (global variable)
        }

        //If eval’ed code needs local variables, change eval to new Function and pass them as arguments:
        let f = new Function('a', 'alert(a)');
        f(5); // 5

        /*
            The new Function construct is explained in the chapter The "new Function" syntax. It creates a function 
            from a string, also in the global scope. So it can’t see local variables. But it’s so much clearer to 
            pass them explicitly as arguments, like in the example above.
