        A Proxy object wraps another object and intercepts operations, like reading/writing properties and 
        others, optionally handling them on its own, or transparently allowing the object to handle them.

        Proxies are used in many libraries and some browser frameworks. We’ll see many practical applications 
        in this article.

        Proxy:
        The syntax:
        let proxy = new Proxy(target, handler)

            1.target – is an object to wrap, can be anything, including functions.
            2.handler – proxy configuration: an object with “traps”, methods that intercept operations. – 
            e.g. get trap for reading a property of target, set trap for writing a property into target, and so on.

        For operations on proxy, if there’s a corresponding trap in handler, then it runs, and the proxy has a 
        chance to handle it, otherwise the operation is performed on target.

        As a starting example, let’s create a proxy without any traps:

        let target = {};
        let proxy = new Proxy(target, {}); // empty handler

        proxy.test = 5; // writing to proxy (1)
        alert(target.test); // 5, the property appeared in target!

        alert(proxy.test); // 5, we can read it from proxy too (2)

        for(let key in proxy) alert(key); // test, iteration works (3)

        As there are no traps, all operations on proxy are forwarded to target.
            1.A writing operation proxy.test= sets the value on target.
            2.A reading operation proxy.test returns the value from target.
            3.Iteration over proxy returns values from target.
        
        As we can see, without any traps, proxy is a transparent wrapper around target.
