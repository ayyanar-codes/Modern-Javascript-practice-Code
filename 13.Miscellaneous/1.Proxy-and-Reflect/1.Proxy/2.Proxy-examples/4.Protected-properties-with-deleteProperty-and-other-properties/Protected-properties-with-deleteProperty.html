        Protected properties with “deleteProperty” and other traps:
        There’s a widespread convention that properties and methods prefixed by an underscore 
        _ are internal. They shouldn’t be accessed from outside the object.

        Technically that’s possible though:
        
    -->
    <script>
        let userObj = {
            name: "John",
            _password: "secret"
        };

        alert(userObj._password); // secret
    </script>

<!--
    Let’s use proxies to prevent any access to properties starting with _.
    We’ll need the traps:
        1. get to throw an error when reading such property,
        2. set to throw an error when writing,
        3. deleteProperty to throw an error when deleting,
        4. ownKeys to exclude properties starting with _ from for..in and methods like Object.keys.
    
    Here’s the code:
-->

<script>

    let user = {
        name: "John",
        _password: "***"
    };

    user = new Proxy(user, {
        get(target, prop) {
            if (prop.startsWith('_')) {
            throw new Error("Access denied");
            }
            let value = target[prop];
            return (typeof value === 'function') ? value.bind(target) : value; // (*)
        },


        set(target, prop, val) { // to intercept property writing
            if (prop.startsWith('_')) {
            throw new Error("Access denied");
            } else {
            target[prop] = val;
            return true;
            }
        },


        deleteProperty(target, prop) { // to intercept property deletion
            if (prop.startsWith('_')) {
            throw new Error("Access denied");
            } else {
            delete target[prop];
            return true;
            }
        },


        ownKeys(target) { // to intercept property list
            return Object.keys(target).filter(key => !key.startsWith('_'));
        }
    });

    // "get" doesn't allow to read _password
    try {
    alert(user._password); // Error: Access denied
    } catch(e) { alert(e.message); }

    // "set" doesn't allow to write _password
    try {
    user._password = "test"; // Error: Access denied
    } catch(e) { alert(e.message); }

    // "deleteProperty" doesn't allow to delete _password
    try {
    delete user._password; // Error: Access denied
    } catch(e) { alert(e.message); }

    // "ownKeys" filters out _password
    for(let key in user) alert(key); // name

</script>


<!--
    Please note the important detail in the get trap, in the line (*):

    get(target, prop) {
        // ...
        let value = target[prop];
        return (typeof value === 'function') ? value.bind(target) : value; // (*)
    }

    Why do we need a function to call value.bind(target)?
    The reason is that object methods, such as user.checkPassword(), must be able to access _password:
    user = {    
        // ...
        checkPassword(value) {
            // object method must be able to read _password
            return value === this._password;
        }
    }

    A call to user.checkPassword() gets proxied user as this (the object before dot becomes this), so when 
    it tries to access this._password, the get trap activates (it triggers on any property read) and throws 
    an error.

    So we bind the context of object methods to the original object, target, in the line (*). Then their future 
    calls will use target as this, without any traps.

    That solution usually works, but isn’t ideal, as a method may pass the unproxied object somewhere else, 
    and then we’ll get messed up: where’s the original object, and where’s the proxied one?

    Besides, an object may be proxied multiple times (multiple proxies may add different “tweaks” to the object), 
    and if we pass an unwrapped object to a method, there may be unexpected consequences.

    So, such a proxy shouldn’t be used everywhere.


    Private properties of a class
    Modern JavaScript engines natively support private properties in classes, prefixed with #. They are described 
    in the article Private and protected properties and methods. No proxies required.

    Such properties have their own issues though. In particular, they are not inherited.
