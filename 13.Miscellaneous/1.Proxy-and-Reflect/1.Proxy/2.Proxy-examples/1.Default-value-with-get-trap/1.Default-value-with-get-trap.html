    <!--
        MOst common traps are reading/writing properties.

        To intercept reading, the handler should have a method get(target,property, receiver).

        it triggers when a property is read with following arguments:

            1. target is the target object, the one passed as the first argument to new Proxcy
            2. property -property name
            3. receiver- If the target property is getter, then receiver is the object that's going 
            to used as 'this' in its call. Usually that's the proxy objectitself (or an object that inherit
            from it, if we inherit from Proxy). Right now we dont need this argument, so it will explained in
            more detail later.

        let's use get to impliment default values for an object.

        we will make an numeric array that returns 0 for nonexistnat values.

        Usually when one tries to get a non-existing array item, then get undefined. But we will wrap 
        a regular array into the proxy that traps reading and return 0 if there is no such property.
