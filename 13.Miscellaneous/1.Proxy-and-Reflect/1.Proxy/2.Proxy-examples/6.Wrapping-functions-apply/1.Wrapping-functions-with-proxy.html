            Proxy is much more powerful, as it forwards everything to the target object.
            Let’s use Proxy instead of a wrapping function:

        */

        function delay(f, ms) {
            return new Proxy(f, {
                apply(target, thisArg, args) {
                setTimeout(() => target.apply(thisArg, args), ms);
                }
            });
        }

        function sayHi(user) {
            alert(`Hello, ${user}!`);
        }

        sayHi = delay(sayHi, 3000);

        alert(sayHi.length); // 1 (*) proxy forwards "get length" operation to the target

        sayHi("John"); // Hello, John! (after 3 seconds)

        /*
            The result is the same, but now not only calls, but all operations on the proxy are forwarded to 
            the original function. So sayHi.length is returned correctly after the wrapping in the line (*).

            We’ve got a “richer” wrapper.

            Other traps exist: the full list is in the beginning of this article. Their usage pattern is similar 
            to the above.
