            Wrapping functions: "apply"
            We can wrap a proxy around a function as well.
            The apply(target, thisArg, args) trap handles calling a proxy as function:
                1. target is the target object (function is an object in JavaScript),
                2. thisArg is the value of this.
                3. args is a list of arguments.
            For example, let’s recall delay(f, ms) decorator, that we did in the article Decorators and forwarding, 
            call/apply.

            In that article we did it without proxies. A call to delay(f, ms) returned a function that forwards 
            all calls to f after ms milliseconds.


        */


        //Here’s the previous, function-based implementation:

        function delay(func, ms){
            //return wrapper that passes the call to func after the timeout
            return function(){
                setTimeout(()=>func.apply(this, arguments), ms);
            };
        }

        function sayHi(user){
            alert(`Hi ${user}!`);
        }

        //after this wrapping, calls to sayHi will be delayed 3 seconds
        sayHi=delay(sayHi, 3000);

        sayHi("Ayyanar"); // Hello, Ayyanar! (after 3 seconds)
        alert(sayHi.length);  //we lost function arguments length
        alert(sayHi.name);   //we lost function name
