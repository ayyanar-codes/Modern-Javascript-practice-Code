            Built-in objects: Internal slots:
            Many built-in objects, for example Map, Set, Date, Promise and others make use of so-called 
            “internal slots”.

            These are like properties, but reserved for internal, specification-only purposes. For instance, 
            Map stores items in the internal slot [[MapData]]. Built-in methods access them directly, not 
            via [[Get]]/[[Set]] internal methods. So Proxy can’t intercept that.

            Why care? They’re internal anyway!

            Well, here’s the issue. After a built-in object like that gets proxied, the proxy doesn’t have 
            these internal slots, so built-in methods will fail.

            For example:
            let map = new Map();
            let proxy = new Proxy(map, {});
            proxy.set('test', 1); // Error

            Internally, a Map stores all data in its [[MapData]] internal slot. The proxy doesn’t have such 
            a slot. The built-in method Map.prototype.set method tries to access the internal property 
            this.[[MapData]], but because this=proxy, can’t find it in proxy and just fails.

            Fortunately, there’s a way to fix it:

        */

        let map = new Map();

        let proxy = new Proxy(map, {
            get(target, prop, receiver) {
                let value = Reflect.get(...arguments);
                return typeof value == 'function' ? value.bind(target) : value;
            }
        });

        proxy.set('test', 1);
        alert(proxy.get('test')); // 1 (works!)

        /*
        Now it works fine, because get trap binds function properties, such as map.set, to the target object 
        (map) itself.

        Unlike the previous example, the value of this inside proxy.set(...) will be not proxy, but the original 
        map. So when the internal implementation of set tries to access this.[[MapData]] internal slot, it succeeds.

        Array has no internal slots:
        A notable exception: built-in Array doesn’t use internal slots. That’s for historical reasons, as it appeared 
        so long ago.
        So there’s no such problem when proxying an array.
