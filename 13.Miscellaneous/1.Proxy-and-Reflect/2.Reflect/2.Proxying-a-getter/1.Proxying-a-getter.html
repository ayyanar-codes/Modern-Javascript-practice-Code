            Proxying a getter:
            Let’s see an example that demonstrates why Reflect.get is better. And we’ll also see why get/set have the 
            third argument receiver, that we didn’t use before.

            We have an object user with _name property and a getter for it.
            Here’s a proxy around it:
        */

        let userObj = {
            _name: "Guest",
            get name() {
                return this._name;
            }
        };

        let userProxyObj = new Proxy(user, {
            get(target, prop, receiver) {
                return target[prop];
            }
        });

        alert(userProxyObj.name); // Guest


        /*
            The get trap is “transparent” here, it returns the original property, and doesn’t do anything else. 
            That’s enough for our example.

            Everything seems to be all right. But let’s make the example a little bit more complex.

            After inheriting another object admin from user, we can observe the incorrect behavior:

        */

        let user = {
            _name: "Guest",
            get name() {
                return this._name;
        }
        };

        let userProxy = new Proxy(user, {
            get(target, prop, receiver) {
                return target[prop]; // (*) target = user
            }
        });

        let admin = {
            __proto__: userProxy,
            _name: "Admin"
        };

        // Expected: Admin
        alert(admin.name); // outputs: Guest (?!?)
