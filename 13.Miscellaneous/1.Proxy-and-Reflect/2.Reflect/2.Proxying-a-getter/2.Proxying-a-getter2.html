            To fix such (previous example) situations, we need receiver, the third argument of get trap. It keeps the correct this to be passed to a 
            getter. In our case that’s admin.

            How to pass the context for a getter? For a regular function we could use call/apply, but that’s a getter, it’s not 
            “called”, just accessed.

            Reflect.get can do that. Everything will work right if we use it.

            Here’s the corrected variant:
        */

        let user = {
            _name: "Guest",
            get name() {
                return this._name;
            }
        };

        let userProxy = new Proxy(user, {
            get(target, prop, receiver) { // receiver = admin
                return Reflect.get(target, prop, receiver); // (*)
            }
        });


        let admin = {
            __proto__: userProxy,
            _name: "Admin"
        };

        alert(admin.name); // Admin
