        /*
        When we develop something, we often need our own error classes to reflect specific things that may 
        go wrong in our tasks. For errors in network operations we may need HttpError, for database 
        operations DbError, for searching operations NotFoundError and so on.

        Our errors should support basic error properties like message, name and, preferably, stack. But 
        they also may have other properties of their own, e.g. HttpError objects may have a statusCode 
        property with a value like 404 or 403 or 500.

        JavaScript allows to use throw with any argument, so technically our custom error classes don’t 
        need to inherit from Error. But if we inherit, then it becomes possible to use obj instanceof Error 
        to identify error objects. So it’s better to inherit from it.

        As the application grows, our own errors naturally form a hierarchy. For instance, HttpTimeoutError
         may inherit from HttpError, and so on.

         Extending Error:
         As an example, let’s consider a function readUser(json) that should read JSON with user data.

        Here’s an example of how a valid json may look:
            let json = `{ "name": "John", "age": 30 }`;

        Internally, we’ll use JSON.parse. If it receives malformed json, then it throws SyntaxError. But 
        even if json is syntactically correct, that doesn’t mean that it’s a valid user, right? It may miss 
        the necessary data. For instance, it may not have name and age properties that are essential for 
        our users.

        Our function readUser(json) will not only read JSON, but check (“validate”) the data. If there are 
        no required fields, or the format is wrong, then that’s an error. And that’s not a SyntaxError, 
        because the data is syntactically correct, but another kind of error. We’ll call it ValidationError
         and create a class for it. An error of that kind should also carry the information about the 
         offending field.

        Our ValidationError class should inherit from the Error class.

        The Error class is built-in, but here’s its approximate code so we can understand what we’re 
        extending:
        // The "pseudocode" for the built-in Error class defined by JavaScript itself
        class Error {
            constructor(message) {
                this.message = message;
                this.name = "Error"; // (different names for different built-in error classes)
                this.stack = <call stack>; // non-standard, but most environments support it
            }
        }
        */

        //Now let’s inherit ValidationError from it and try it in action:
        class ValidationError extends Error{
            constructor(message){
                super(message);
                this.name='Validation error (custom)';
            }
        }

        function fnTest(){
            try{
                throw new ValidationError('Whoops!')
            } catch(err){
                console.log(err);
                alert(err.message);  //Whoops!
                alert(err.name); //Validation error (custom)
                alert(err.stack);  //list of nested calls
            }
        }

        function newTestPro(){
            fnTest();
        }

        function latestFnforTest(){
            newTestPro();
        }

        function altimateFunc(){
            latestFnforTest();
        }

        altimateFunc();
