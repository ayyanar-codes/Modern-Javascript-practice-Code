            As we’ve known before, generally functions are “free”, not bound to objects in JavaScript. 
            So they can be copied between objects and called with another this.

            The very existence of [[HomeObject]] violates that principle, because methods remember their
            objects. [[HomeObject]] can’t be changed, so this bond is forever.

            The only place in the language where [[HomeObject]] is used – is super. So, if a method 
            does not use super, then we can still consider it free and copy between objects. But with super 
            things may go wrong.

            Here’s the demo of a wrong super result after copying:
        */

        let animal = {
            sayHi() {
                alert(`I'm an animal`);
            }
        };

        // rabbit inherits from animal
        let rabbit = {
            __proto__: animal,
            sayHi() {
                super.sayHi();
            }
        };

        let plant = {
            sayHi() {
                alert("I'm a plant");
            }
        };

        // tree inherits from plant
        let tree = {
            __proto__: plant,
            sayHi: rabbit.sayHi // (*)
        };

        tree.sayHi();  // I'm an animal (?!?)


        /*
            A call to tree.sayHi() shows “I’m an animal”. Definitely wrong.

            The reason is simple:
            1.In the line (*), the method tree.sayHi was copied from rabbit. 
            Maybe we just wanted to avoid code duplication?
            2.Its [[HomeObject]] is rabbit, as it was created in rabbit. There’s 
            no way to change [[HomeObject]].
            3.The code of tree.sayHi() has super.sayHi() inside. It goes up from 
            rabbit and takes the method from animal.
