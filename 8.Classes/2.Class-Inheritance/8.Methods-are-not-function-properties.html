            [[HomeObject]] is defined for methods both in classes and in plain objects. But for objects,
             methods must be specified exactly as method(), not as "method: function()"

             The difference may be non-essential for us, but it’s important for JavaScript.

             In the example below a non-method syntax is used for comparison. [[HomeObject]] 
             property is not set and the inheritance doesn’t work:
        */

        let animal = {
            eat: function() { // intentionally writing like this instead of eat() {...
                // ...
            }
        };

        let rabbit = {
            __proto__: animal,
            eat: function() {
                super.eat();
            }
        };

        rabbit.eat();  // Error calling super (because there's no [[HomeObject]])
