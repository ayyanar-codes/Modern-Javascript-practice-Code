        /*
            To provide the solution, JavaScript adds one more special internal property for functions: [[HomeObject]].

            When a function is specified as a class or object method, its [[HomeObject]] property becomes that object.

            Then super uses it to resolve the parent prototype and its methods.

            Letâ€™s see how it works, first with plain objects:
        */

        let animal = {
            name: "Animal",
            eat() {         // animal.eat.[[HomeObject]] == animal
                alert(`${this.name} eats.`);
            }
        };

        let rabbit = {
            __proto__: animal,
            name: "Rabbit",
            eat() {         // rabbit.eat.[[HomeObject]] == rabbit
                super.eat();
            }
        };

        let longEar = {
            __proto__: rabbit,
            name: "Long Ear",
            eat() {         // longEar.eat.[[HomeObject]] == longEar
                super.eat();
            }
        };

        // works correctly
        longEar.eat();  // Long Ear eats.

        /*
            It works as intended, due to [[HomeObject]] mechanics. A method, such as longEar.eat, knows
            its [[HomeObject]] and takes the parent method from its prototype. Without any use of this.
