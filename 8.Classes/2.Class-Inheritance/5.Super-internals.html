        */


        /*
            Let’s get a little deeper under the hood of super. We’ll see some interesting things along the way.

            First to say, from all that we’ve learned till now, it’s impossible for super to work at all!

            Yeah, indeed, let’s ask ourselves, how it should technically work? When an object method 
            runs, it gets the current object as this. If we call super.method() then, the engine needs 
            to get the method from the prototype of the current object. But how?

            The task may seem simple, but it isn’t. The engine knows the current object this, so it could get the
             parent method as this.__proto__.method. Unfortunately, such a “naive” solution won’t work.


            Let’s demonstrate the problem. Without classes, using plain objects for the sake of simplicity.

            You may skip this part and go below to the [[HomeObject]] subsection if you don’t want to know the 
            details. That won’t harm. Or read on if you’re interested in understanding things in-depth.

            In the example below, rabbit.__proto__ = animal. Now let’s try: in rabbit.eat() we’ll call animal.eat(), 
            using this.__proto__:


        */


        let animal = {
            name: "Animal",
            eat() {
                alert(`${this.name} eats.`);
            }
        };
        let rabbit = {
            __proto__: animal,
            name: "Rabbit",
            eat() {
                // that's how super.eat() could presumably work
                this.__proto__.eat.call(this); // (*)
            }
        };

        /*
            At the line (*) we take eat from the prototype (animal) and call it in the context of the 
            current object. Please note that .call(this) is important here, because a simple 
            this.__proto__.eat() would execute parent eat in the context of the prototype, not the 
            current object.

            And in the code above it actually works as intended: we have the correct alert.

            Now let’s add one more object to the chain. We’ll see how things break:
        */

        let animal2 = {
            name: "Animal",
            eat() {
                alert(`${this.name} eats.`);
            }
        };

        let rabbit2 = {
            __proto__: animal2,
            eat() {
                // ...bounce around rabbit-style and call parent (animal) method
                this.__proto__.eat.call(this); // (*)
            }
        };

        let longEar = {
            __proto__: rabbit2,
            eat() {
                // ...do something with long ears and call parent (rabbit) method
                this.__proto__.eat.call(this); // (**)
            }
        };

        longEar.eat(); // Error: Maximum call stack size exceeded

        rabbit.eat(); // Rabbit eats.

        /*
            The code doesn’t work anymore! We can see the error trying to call longEar.eat().

            It may be not that obvious, but if we trace longEar.eat() call, then we can see why. In 
            both lines (*) and (**) the value of this is the current object (longEar). That’s 
            essential: all object methods get the current object as this, not a prototype or 
            something.

            So, in both lines (*) and (**) the value of this.__proto__ is exactly the same: rabbit. 
            They both call rabbit.eat without going up the chain in the endless loop.

        */

        //1. Inside longEar.eat(), the line (**) calls rabbit.eat providing it with this=longEar.
        // inside longEar.eat() we have this = longEar
        this.__proto__.eat.call(this) // (**)
        // becomes
        longEar.__proto__.eat.call(this)
        // that is
        rabbit.eat.call(this);


        //2.Then in the line (*) of rabbit.eat, we’d like to pass the call even higher in the chain,
        // but this=longEar, so this.__proto__.eat is again rabbit.eat!
        // inside rabbit.eat() we also have this = longEar
        this.__proto__.eat.call(this) // (*)
        // becomes
        longEar.__proto__.eat.call(this)
        // or (again)
        rabbit.eat.call(this);

        //3.…So rabbit.eat calls itself in the endless loop, because it can’t ascend any further.
        //The problem can’t be solved by using this alone.
