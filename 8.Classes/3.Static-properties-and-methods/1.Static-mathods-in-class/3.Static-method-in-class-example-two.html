        /*
            Here Article.compare method stands “above” articles, as a means to compare them. It’s not a method of an article, but rather of the whole class.

            Another example would be a so-called “factory” method.

            Let’s say, we need multiple ways to create an article:

            1.Create by given parameters (title, date etc).
            2.Create an empty article with today’s date.
            3.…or else somehow.
            The first way can be implemented by the constructor. And for the second one we can make a static method of the class.

            Such as Article.createTodays() here:
        */

        class Article {
            constructor(title, date) {
                this.title = title;
                this.date = date;
            }

            static createTodays() {
                // remember, this = Article
                return new this("Today's digest", new Date());
            }
        }

        let article = Article.createTodays();

        alert( article.title ); // Today's digest

        /*
            Now every time we need to create a today’s digest, we can call Article.createTodays(). Once again, that’s not a method of an article, but a method of the whole class.

            Static methods are also used in database-related classes to search/save/remove entries from the database, like this:
        */

        // assuming Article is a special class for managing articles
        // static method to remove the article by id:
        Article.remove({id: 12345});
