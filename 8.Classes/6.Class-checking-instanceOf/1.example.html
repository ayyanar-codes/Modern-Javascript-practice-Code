            The instanceof operator allows to check whether an object belongs to a 
            certain class. It also takes inheritance into account.

            Such a check may be necessary in many cases. For example, it can be used for 
            building a polymorphic function, the one that treats arguments differently 
            depending on their type.

            The syntax is:
                obj instanceof Class
        */

        class Rabbit {}
        let rabbit = new Rabbit();

        // is it an object of Rabbit class?
        alert( rabbit instanceof Rabbit ); // true
