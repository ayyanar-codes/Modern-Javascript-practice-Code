            Internal and external interface:
            In object-oriented programming, properties and methods are split into two groups:

                1.Internal interface – methods and properties, accessible from other methods of the class, but not from the outside.
                2.External interface – methods and properties, accessible also from outside the class.
                
            If we continue the analogy with the coffee machine – what’s hidden inside: a boiler tube, heating element, and so on – is its internal interface.

            An internal interface is used for the object to work, its details use each other. For instance, a boiler tube is attached to the heating element.

            But from the outside a coffee machine is closed by the protective cover, so that no one can reach those. Details are hidden and inaccessible. We can use its features via the external interface.

            So, all we need to use an object is to know its external interface. We may be completely unaware how it works inside, and that’s great.

            That was a general introduction.

            In JavaScript, there are two types of object fields (properties and methods):

            Public: accessible from anywhere. They comprise the external interface. Until now we were only using public properties and methods.
            Private: accessible only from inside the class. These are for the internal interface.
            In many other languages there also exist “protected” fields: accessible only from inside the class and those extending it (like private, but plus access from inheriting classes). They are also useful for the internal interface. They are in a sense more widespread than private ones, because we usually want inheriting classes to gain access to them.

            Protected fields are not implemented in JavaScript on the language level, but in practice they are very convenient, so they are emulated.

            Now we’ll make a coffee machine in JavaScript with all these types of properties. A coffee machine has a lot of details, we won’t model them to stay simple (though we could).
