            One of the most important principles of object oriented programming – delimiting internal interface from the external one.

            That is “a must” practice in developing anything more complex than a “hello world” app.

            To understand this, let’s break away from development and turn our eyes into the real world.

            Usually, devices that we’re using are quite complex. But delimiting the internal interface from the external one allows to use them without problems.
        
            A real-life example:
            For instance, a coffee machine. Simple from outside: a button, a display, a few holes…And, surely, the result – great coffee! :)
            Coffee machines are quite reliable, aren’t they? We can use one for years, and only if something goes wrong – bring it for repairs.

            The secret of reliability and simplicity of a coffee machine – all details are well-tuned and hidden inside.

            If we remove the protective cover from the coffee machine, then using it will be much more complex (where to press?), and dangerous (it can electrocute).

            As we’ll see, in programming objects are like coffee machines.

            But in order to hide inner details, we’ll use not a protective cover, but rather special syntax of the language and conventions.
