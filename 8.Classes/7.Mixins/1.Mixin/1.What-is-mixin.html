            In JavaScript we can only inherit from a single object. There can be only one [[Prototype]] for an 
            object. And a class may extend only one other class.

            But sometimes that feels limiting. For instance, we have a class StreetSweeper and a class Bicycle, 
            and want to make their mix: a StreetSweepingBicycle.

            Or we have a class User and a class EventEmitter that implements event generation, and we’d like to 
            add the functionality of EventEmitter to User, so that our users can emit events.

            There’s a concept that can help here, called “mixins”.

            As defined in Wikipedia, a mixin is a class containing methods that can be used by other classes 
            without a need to inherit from it.

            In other words, a mixin provides methods that implement a certain behavior, but we do not use it 
            alone, we use it to add the behavior to other classes.
