        /*
            An interesting question may arise in the example above: what’s the value of this 
            inside set fullName(value)? Where are the properties this.name and this.surname written: into user or admin?

            The answer is simple: this is not affected by prototypes at all.

            No matter where the method is found: in an object or its prototype. In a method call, 
            this is always the object before the dot.

            So, the setter call admin.fullName= uses admin as this, not user.

            That is actually a super-important thing, because we may have a big object 
            with many methods, and have objects that inherit from it. And when the 
            inheriting objects run the inherited methods, they will modify only their 
            own states, not the state of the big object.

            For instance, here animal represents a “method storage”, and rabbit makes use of it.

            The call rabbit.sleep() sets this.isSleeping on the rabbit object:
            
        */

        let animal={
            walk(){
                if(this.isSleeping){
                    alert('I walk');
                }
            },
            sleep(){
                this.isSleeping=true;
            }
        };

        let rabbit={
            name:"white rabbit",
            __proto__:animal,
        };

        //Modifies rabbit.isSleeping
        rabbit.sleep();
        //animal.sleep();
        
        alert(rabbit.isSleeping);  //true
        alert(animal.isSleeping);   //undefined
