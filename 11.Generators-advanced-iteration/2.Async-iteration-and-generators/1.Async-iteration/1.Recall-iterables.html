            Asynchronous iteration allow us to iterate over data that comes asynchronously, on-demand. Like, 
            for instance, when we download something chunk-by-chunk over a network. And asynchronous generators 
            make it even more convenient.

        //Let’s see a simple example first, to grasp the syntax, and then review a real-life use case.

        let range = {

            …And we’d like to use for..of loop on it, such as for(value of range), to get values from 1 to 5.

            In other words, we want to add an iteration ability to the object.

            That can be implemented using a special method with the name Symbol.iterator:
                This method is called in by the for..of construct when the loop is started, and it should return 
                an object with the next method.
                For each iteration, the next() method is invoked for the next value.
                The next() should return a value in the form {done: true/false, value:<loop value>}, where 
                done:true means the end of the loop.
