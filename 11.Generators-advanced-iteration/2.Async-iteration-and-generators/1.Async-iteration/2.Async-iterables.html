            Asynchronous iteration is needed when values come asynchronously: after setTimeout or 
            another kind of delay.

            The most common case is that the object needs to make a network request to deliver the next value, 
            we’ll see a real-life example of it a bit later.

            To make an object iterable asynchronously:
                1.Use Symbol.asyncIterator instead of Symbol.iterator.
                2.The next() method should return a promise (to be fulfilled with the next value).
                    1.The async keyword handles it, we can simply make async next().
                3.To iterate over such an object, we should use a for await (let item of iterable) loop.
                    1.Note the await word.

            As a starting example, let’s make an iterable range object, similar like the one before, but now it will 
            return values asynchronously, one per second.


        */

        let range = {
            from: 1,
            to: 5,

            [Symbol.asyncIterator]() { // (1)
                return {
                current: this.from,
                last: this.to,

                async next() { // (2)

                    // note: we can use "await" inside the async next:
                    await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 1000)); // (3)

                    if (this.current <= this.last) {
                    return { done: false, value: this.current++ };
                    } else {
                    return { done: true };
                    }
                }
                };
            }
        };

        (async () => {

            for await (let value of range) { // (4)
                alert(value); // 1,2,3,4,5
            }

        })()

        /*
            As we can see, the structure is similar to regular iterators:

            1.To make an object asynchronously iterable, it must have a method Symbol.asyncIterator (1).
            2.This method must return the object with next() method returning a promise (2).
            3.The next() method doesn’t have to be async, it may be a regular method returning a promise, 
            but async allows us to use await, so that’s convenient. Here we just delay for a second (3).
            4.To iterate, we use for await(let value of range) (4), namely add “await” after “for”. 
            It calls range[Symbol.asyncIterator]() once, and then its next() for values.
