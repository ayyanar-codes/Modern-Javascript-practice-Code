        /*
            Generator composition is a special feature of generators that allows to transparently
             “embed” generators in each other.

             For instance, we have a function that generates a sequence of numbers:

        */

        function* generateSequence(start, end) {
            for (let i = start; i <= end; i++) yield i;
        }

        /*
            Now we’d like to reuse it to generate a more complex sequence:
                first, digits 0..9 (with character codes 48…57),
                followed by uppercase alphabet letters A..Z (character codes 65…90)
                followed by lowercase alphabet letters a..z (character codes 97…122)
            
            We can use this sequence e.g. to create passwords by selecting characters from it 
            (could add syntax characters as well), but let’s generate it first.

            In a regular function, to combine results from multiple other functions, we call them, 
            store the results, and then join at the end.

            For generators, there’s a special yield* syntax to “embed” (compose) one generator into another.

            The composed generator:
        */

        function* generateSequence(start, end) {
            for (let i = start; i <= end; i++) yield i;
        }

        function* generatePasswordCodes() {

            // 0..9
            yield* generateSequence(48, 57);

            // A..Z
            yield* generateSequence(65, 90);

            // a..z
            yield* generateSequence(97, 122);

        }

        let str = '';

        for(let code of generatePasswordCodes()) {
            str += String.fromCharCode(code);
        }

        alert(str); // 0..9A..Za..z

        /*
            The yield* directive delegates the execution to another generator. This term means 
            that yield* gen iterates over the generator gen and transparently forwards its yields outside.
             As if the values were yielded by the outer generator.
        */

        //The result is the same as if we inlined the code from nested generators:

        function* generateSequence(start, end) {
            for (let i = start; i <= end; i++) yield i;
        }

        function* generateAlphaNum() {

        // yield* generateSequence(48, 57);
        for (let i = 48; i <= 57; i++) yield i;

        // yield* generateSequence(65, 90);
        for (let i = 65; i <= 90; i++) yield i;

        // yield* generateSequence(97, 122);
        for (let i = 97; i <= 122; i++) yield i;

        }

        let str1 = '';

        for(let code of generateAlphaNum()) {
            str1 += String.fromCharCode(code);
        }

        alert(str1); // 0..9A..Za..z


        /*
            A generator composition is a natural way to insert a flow of one generator into another. It doesn’t 
            use extra memory to store intermediate results.
