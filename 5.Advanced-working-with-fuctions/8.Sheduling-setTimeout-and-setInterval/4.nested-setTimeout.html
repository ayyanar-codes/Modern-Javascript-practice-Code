            There are two ways of running something regularly.
            One is setInterval. The other one is a nested setTimeout, like this:
        */

        /** instead of:
        let timerId = setInterval(() => alert('tick'), 2000);
        */

        let timerId = setTimeout(function tick() {
        alert('tick');
        timerId = setTimeout(tick, 2000); // (*)
        }, 2000);


        /*
            The setTimeout above schedules the next call right at the end of the current one (*).
            The nested setTimeout is a more flexible method than setInterval. This way the next call 
            may be scheduled differently, depending on the results of the current one.
            For instance, we need to write a service that sends a request to the server every 
            5 seconds asking for data, but in case the server is overloaded, it should increase the interval to 10, 20, 40 seconds…
        
            let delay = 5000;

            let timerId = setTimeout(function request() {
            ...send request...

            if (request failed due to server overload) {
                // increase the interval to the next run
                delay *= 2;
            }

            timerId = setTimeout(request, delay);

            }, delay);
        
            And if the functions that we’re scheduling are CPU-hungry, then we can measure the time taken by the execution and plan the next call sooner or later.

            Nested setTimeout allows to set the delay between the executions more precisely than setInterval.

            Let’s compare two code fragments. The first one uses setInterval:


         */


         let i = 1;
            setInterval(function() {
            func(i++);
        }, 100);


        /*
            The second one uses nested setTimeout:
        */
       
        let j = 1;
            setTimeout(function run() {
            func(j++);
            setTimeout(run, 100);
        }, 100);
