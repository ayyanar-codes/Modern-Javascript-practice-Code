 <!--Let’s start with the following simple document:-->

<!--
    On the picture above, you can click on element nodes and their children will open/collapse. Every tree node is 
    an object.

    Tags are element nodes (or just elements) and form the tree structure: <html> is at the root, then <head> and <body> are its children, etc.
    The text inside elements forms text nodes, labelled as #text. A text node contains only a string. It may not have children and is always a 
    leaf of the tree. For instance, the <title> tag has the text "About elk".
    
    Please note the special characters in text nodes:
    1. a newline: ↵ (in JavaScript known as \n)
    2. a space: ␣

    Spaces and newlines are totally valid characters, like letters and digits. They form text nodes and become a 
    part of the DOM. So, for instance, in the example above the <head> tag contains some spaces before <title>, and 
    that text becomes a #text node (it contains a newline and some spaces only).

    There are only two top-level exclusions:
    1. Spaces and newlines before <head> are ignored for historical reasons.
    2. If we put something after </body>, then that is automatically moved inside the body, at the end, as the HTML 
    spec requires that all content must be inside <body>. So there can’t be any spaces after </body>.

    In other cases everything’s straightforward – if there are spaces (just like any character) in the document, 
    then they become text nodes in the DOM, and if we remove them, then there won’t be any.

    Here are no space-only text nodes:
    <!DOCTYPE HTML>
    <html><head><title>About elk</title></head><body>The truth about elk.</body></html>

<!--Note-->
<!--
    Spaces at string start/end and space-only text nodes are usually hidden in tools
    Browser tools (to be covered soon) that work with DOM usually do not show spaces at the start/end of the text 
    and empty text nodes (line-breaks) between tags.
    Developer tools save screen space this way.
    On further DOM pictures we’ll sometimes omit them when they are irrelevant. Such spaces usually do not affect 
    how the document is displayed.
