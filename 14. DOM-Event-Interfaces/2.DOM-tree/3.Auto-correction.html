        If the browser encounters malformed HTML, it automatically corrects it when making the DOM.

        For instance, the top tag is always <html>. Even if it doesn’t exist in the document, it will exist in the DOM, because the browser will create it. The same goes for <body>.

        As an example, if the HTML file is the single word "Hello", the browser will wrap it into <html> and <body>, and add the required <head>, and the DOM will be:
    -->

    <p>Hello
        <li>Mom
        <li>and
        <li>Dad

            <!--
                …will become a normal DOM as the browser reads tags and restores the missing parts:
            -->

            <!--note-->
            <!--
                Tables always have <tbody>
                An interesting “special case” is tables. By DOM specification they must have <tbody> tag, but HTML text may omit it. Then the browser creates <tbody> in the DOM automatically.

                For the HTML:

                <table id="table"><tr><td>1</td></tr></table>
            -->
</body>
