<!--
    Note:1
    Please don’t use id-named global variables to access elements

    This behavior is described in the specification, but it is supported mainly for compatibility.

    The browser tries to help us by mixing namespaces of JS and DOM. That’s fine for simple scripts, inlined into HTML, but 
    generally isn’t a good thing. There may be naming conflicts. Also, when one reads JS code and doesn’t have HTML in view, it’s 
    not obvious where the variable comes from.

    Here in the tutorial we use id to directly reference an element for brevity, when it’s obvious where the element comes from.

    In real life document.getElementById is the preferred method.

<!--
    Note:2
    The id must be unique

    The id must be unique. There can be only one element in the document with the given id.

    If there are multiple elements with the same id, then the behavior of methods that use it is unpredictable, 
    e.g. document.getElementById may return any of such elements at random. So please stick to the rule and keep id unique.

<!--
    Note:3
    Only document.getElementById, not anyElem.getElementById

    The method getElementById can be called only on document object. It looks for the given id in the whole document.
