<!--
    querySelector:
    The call to elem.querySelector(css) returns the first element for the given CSS selector.

    In other words, the result is the same as elem.querySelectorAll(css)[0], but the latter is looking for all elements and picking 
    one, while elem.querySelector just looks for one. So it’s faster and also shorter to write.
