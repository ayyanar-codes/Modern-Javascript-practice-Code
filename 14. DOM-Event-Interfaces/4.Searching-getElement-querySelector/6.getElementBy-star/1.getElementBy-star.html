    There are also other methods to look for nodes by a tag, class, etc.

    Today, they are mostly history, as querySelector is more powerful and shorter to write.

    So here we cover them mainly for completeness, while you can still find them in the old scripts.

    1. elem.getElementsByTagName(tag) looks for elements with the given tag and returns the collection of them. The tag parameter can also be a star "*" for “any tags”.
    2. elem.getElementsByClassName(className) returns elements that have the given CSS class.
    3. document.getElementsByName(name) returns elements with the given name attribute, document-wide. Very rarely used.

    For instance:
    // get all divs in the document
    let divs = document.getElementsByTagName('div');

<!-- 
    Note:1
    Don’t forget the "s" letter!

    Novice developers sometimes forget the letter "s". That is, they try to call getElementByTagName instead of 
    getElementsByTagName.

    The "s" letter is absent in getElementById, because it returns a single element. But getElementsByTagName returns a collection 
    of elements, so there’s "s" inside.
 -->

 <!--
    Note:2
    It returns a collection, not an element!

    Another widespread novice mistake is to write:
    // doesn't work
    document.getElementsByTagName('input').value = 5;

    That won’t work, because it takes a collection of inputs and assigns the value to it rather than to elements inside it.

    We should either iterate over the collection or get an element by its index, and then assign, like this:
    // should work (if there's an input)
    document.getElementsByTagName('input')[0].value = 5;
