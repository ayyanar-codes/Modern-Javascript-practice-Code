            There are two terms that we’ll use from now on:

            Child nodes (or children) – 
            elements that are direct children. In other words, they are nested exactly in the given one. For instance, <head> and <body> are 
            children of <html> element.

            Descendants – all elements that are nested in the given one, including children, their children and so on.
-->



<!--For instance, here <body> has children <div> and <ul> (and few blank text nodes):-->

<html>
<body>
  <div>Begin</div>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <b>Information</b>
    </li>
  </ul>
</body>
</html>


<!--
    …And descendants of <body> are not only direct children <div>, <ul> but also more deeply nested elements, such as <li> (a child of <ul>) 
    and <b> (a child of <li>) – the entire subtree. The childNodes collection lists all child nodes, including text nodes.
