<!--
    Element-only navigation
    Navigation properties listed above refer to all nodes. For instance, in childNodes we can see both text nodes, element nodes, and even 
    comment nodes if they exist.

    But for many tasks we don’t want text or comment nodes. We want to manipulate element nodes that represent tags and form the structure 
    of the page.

    The links are similar to those given above, just with Element word inside:

    1. children – only those children that are element nodes.
    2. firstElementChild, lastElementChild – first and last element children.
    3. previousElementSibling, nextElementSibling – neighbor elements.
    4. parentElement – parent element.
