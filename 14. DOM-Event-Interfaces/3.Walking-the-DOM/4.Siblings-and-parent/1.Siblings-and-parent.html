<!--
    Siblings and the parent:
    Siblings are nodes that are children of the same parent.

    For instance, here <head> and <body> are siblings:
        <html>
             <head>...</head>
             <body>...</body>
        </html>

        Here:
        1. <body> is said to be the “next” or “right” sibling of <head>,
        2. <head> is said to be the “previous” or “left” sibling of <body>.


    The next sibling is in nextSibling property, and the previous one – in previousSibling.

    The parent is available as parentNode.

<!--For example:-->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<script>
"use strict";

// parent of <body> is <html>
alert( document.body.parentNode === document.documentElement ); // true

// after <head> goes <body>
alert( document.head.nextSibling ); // HTMLBodyElement

// before <body> goes <head>
alert( document.body.previousSibling ); // HTMLHeadElement
</script>
