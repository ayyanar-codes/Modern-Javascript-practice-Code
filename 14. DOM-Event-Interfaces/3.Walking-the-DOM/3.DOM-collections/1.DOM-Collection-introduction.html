    As we can see, childNodes looks like an array. But actually it’s not an array, but rather a collection – a special array-like iterable 
    object.


    There are two important consequences:
    
    1. We can use for..of to iterate over it:

        for (let node of document.body.childNodes) {
            alert(node); // shows all nodes from the collection
        }

    That’s because it’s iterable (provides the Symbol.iterator property, as required).


    2. Array methods won’t work, because it’s not an array:

        alert(document.body.childNodes.filter); // undefined (there's no filter method!)

    The first thing is nice. The second is tolerable, because we can use Array.from to create a “real” array from the collection, if we 
    want array methods:

        alert( Array.from(document.body.childNodes).filter ); // function
