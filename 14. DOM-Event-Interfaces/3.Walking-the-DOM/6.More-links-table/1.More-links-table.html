    Till now we described the basic navigation properties.
    Certain types of DOM elements may provide additional properties, specific to their type, for convenience.
    Tables are a great example of that, and represent a particularly important case:

    The <table> element supports (in addition to the given above) these properties:
        1. table.rows – the collection of <tr> elements of the table.
        2. table.caption/tHead/tFoot – references to elements <caption>, <thead>, <tfoot>.
        3. table.tBodies – the collection of <tbody> elements (can be many according to the standard, but there will always be at least 
           one – even if it is not in the source HTML, the browser will put it in the DOM).

    <thead>, <tfoot>, <tbody> elements provide the rows property:
        1. tr.cells – the collection of <td> and <th> cells inside the given <tr>.
        2. tr.sectionRowIndex – the position (index) of the given <tr> inside the enclosing <thead>/<tbody>/<tfoot>.
        3. tr.rowIndex – the number of the <tr> in the table as a whole (including all table rows).
            <td> and <th>:
                1. td.cellIndex – the number of the cell inside the enclosing <tr>.

<!--An example of usage:-->
<table id="table">
    <tr>
      <td>one</td><td>two</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>three</td><td>four</td>
    </tr>
  </table>
  
  <script>
    // get td with "two" (first row, second column)
    let td = table.rows[0].cells[1];
    td.style.backgroundColor = "red"; // highlight it
  </script>

<!--
The specification: tabular data.
There are also additional navigation properties for HTML forms. We’ll look at them later when we start working with forms.
